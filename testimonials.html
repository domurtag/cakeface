                                    I had a party with my friends for my 13<sup>th</sup> birthday. It was great..we learned how to look after our skin, how to deal with spots and what make up was suitable for when. I learned how to put on eye liner and that was my favourite bit. My friends loved it and we all looked great after. We loved it.

                                    We had a Cakeface party for a hen night before we went out, so we all were done up and looked fab! Was great craic, few glasses of wine, talking about make up and treatments and all of us being made up how we always wanted to look. We've all shopping lists now for Christmas!

                                    I had a party for myself and a group of girl friends..it was such a nice way to spend an evening and such a treat. We had to head out afterwards to show off how amazing we all looked afterwards! The Cakeface girls were great fun and taught us all so much. A lot of us were surprised to find we were using the wrong products and we learned how to shop economically and what's best suited to our skin. I'd recommend them for any occasion or just for a treat for you and your best friends!

                        I hosted a Cakeface party for a group of mums and daughters. It was a really special day for all of us. We got to spend time with our teenage daughters in a really relaxed and fun (for both of us) way. Apart from learning loads of new techniques, we have some treasured photos of us both looking gorgeous!
